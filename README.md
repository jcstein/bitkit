# üÖ±Ô∏èitkit

A frontend for an EVM rollup on Bitcoin built with Rollkit.

## The stack

Bitkit is built with [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/), [Rollkit](https://rollkit.dev/), & [Ethermint](https://github.com/celestiaorg/ethermint).

Bitkit is a smart contract demo on a [sovereign rollup](https://celestia.org/glossary/sovereign-rollup) built on Bitcoin to provide [data availability](https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability) & [consensus](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms), leveraging Ethermint with Rollkit as the [execution environment](https://celestia.org/glossary/execution-environment).

This allows users to securely create and share messages on the sovereign rollup secured by Bitcoin without the need for a centralized server or authority.
